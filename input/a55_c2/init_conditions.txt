-----------------------------------
This is a restart of the DeepMIP run using 3xCO2.
It is initialised with equatorial surface temp of 30 degC,
and bottom temp of 10 degC.
Initial state of the atmosphere was taken from the same setup
as the Her_htid run, except that Surface_geopotential was added.
